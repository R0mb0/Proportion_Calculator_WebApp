## 🚀 Features

- **Proportion calculation UI:** Calculate ratios in the form `X : Y = Z : A` with one unknown (`x` or `X`). Enter three known values, set one unknown — get your solution instantly.
- **Responsive design:** Works flawlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Adapts layout for both landscape and portrait modes.
- **Automatic light/dark theme:** Matches your system or browser preference with a smooth animated transition.
- **Multilingual (IT/EN):** Automatically detects your browser language — Italian for Italian settings, English for everything else.
- **Intuitive error handling:** Input checking ensures only one unknown is present. Animated modal popups explain errors or invalid inputs.
- **Calculation history:** All operations are listed at the bottom of the page for reference, with results highlighted in green.
- **Animated highlights:** The solved field is illuminated with a green border for clarity.
- **User help:** Dedicated help button (lifebuoy icon top-right) shows a friendly usage guide in a popup.
- **Reset button:** After each calculation, a prominent reset button lets you quickly clear all fields and start fresh.
- **No dependencies:** Runs entirely client-side, no data upload or server required.

## 💡 How To Use

1. **Open the app** in your browser (just open the link above).
2. Enter three numeric values in the main proportion layout:  
   **Value : Base = Value : Base**
3. In the field you want to solve, type `x` (or `X`). Only one unknown is allowed.
4. Click the **Calcola! / Calculate!** button.
5. The app checks your inputs:
   - If there's an error (multiple unknowns, missing values, etc.) a modal popup appears explaining the issue.
   - If valid, the app calculates the missing value, highlights it in green, and adds the operation to the **cronology/history** below.
6. Optional: Click the **Reset** button to clear the interface and start a new calculation.
7. Tap the lifebuoy icon in the top right for instant help.
